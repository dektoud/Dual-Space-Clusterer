# Dual-Space-Clusterer
Pure(ish) python implementation of the dual-space clustering algorithm.

Fortran modules are built using `compile.py` found in [`pygeostat`](http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/welcome.html)

The included `.pyd` files are built for windows 64 for python 3.6.3 bit with the intel fortran compiler and VS2015. 

NOTE: the included `*.ipynb` (and associated functions) requires the latest [`pygeostat`](http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/welcome.html)
